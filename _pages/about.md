 My name is Emily and I am a first year doctoral student at the [University of Minnesota-Twin Cities Mathematics PhD Program](https://cse.umn.edu/math). I am grateful to be support by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My research interests revolves around stochastic dynamics focused on creating interpretable guarantees for machine learning algorithms.
 
 I first became fascinated in this area through my undergraduate research in opinion dynamics modeling and optimal transport while at the [University of California Santa Barbara College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). Since then, I have been studying causal inference with network interference under the guidance of Cornell ORIE Professor [Christina Lee Yu](https://cleeyu.orie.cornell.edu/). 

 As a first-generation college student, I have been so fortunate to have been able to meet incredible mentors from the [EDGE for Women Program](https://www.edgeforwomen.org/) and the [McNair Scholars Program](https://mcnair.ucsb.edu/), which have aided me in finding my path as a researcher in the mathematical science. Inspired by their example, I remain dedicated welcoming spaces where everyone can be their authentic self and reach their highest potential throughout my career. 

 Outside of math, I enjoy baking, playing board games with friends, and have recently picked up yoga. If you ever want to chat, whether that be math related or not, please reach out to my email [lope0646@umn.edu](lope0646@umn.edu).
