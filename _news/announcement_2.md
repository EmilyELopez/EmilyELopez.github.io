Since its inception, the [EDGE foundation](https://www.edgeforwomen.org/) aims to increase equity in mathematics, support the next generation of STEM leaders, and creating diverse scientific communities. I was fortunate to be part of the 2022 cohort, where I was I able to create lasting friendships and work with other talented women pursuing graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences.
