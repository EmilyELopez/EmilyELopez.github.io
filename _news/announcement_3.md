I was conferred a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from the UC Santa Barbara College of Creative Studies with honors. I won the [Thomas More Storke Award for Excellence](https://news.ucsb.edu/2022/020651/going-out-top), the highest student honor given to a graduating senior who has demonstrated outstanding scholarship and extraordinary service to the university, its students, and the community.
